# Surfs_Up
## Overview
Our investor requested data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. It is important to colelct data about an area before opening a business.

## Results 
We are analyzing the weather differences in June and December because they are very different times of the year and showcase when one might think an ice cream shop would be busy and slow. 
### June Results
- Minimum Temperature = 64
- Maximum Temperature = 85
- Average Temperature = 74.94

## Summary
The results for each month are similar. This will be a good sign for investors to see how successful the shop could be in the summer and winter months. I think another query we could perform for each month is the amount of tourists that travel to ice cream shops in Oahu during those months. This could showcase the amount of business one could expect. Another query idea would be the amount of rainfall during those months as well because that can effect this beach shop.
